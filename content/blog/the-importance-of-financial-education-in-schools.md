Parents also play a vital role in shaping their children's financial understanding and habits.  Here's how parents can support their children's financial literacy journey:

**1. Setting a Positive Example:**
* **Modeling Financial Responsibility:** Children learn by observing their parents. Parents should model responsible financial habits, such as budgeting, saving, and planning for the future.

**2. Teaching Financial Skills:**
* **Age-Appropriate Lessons:**  Parents can teach their children age-appropriate financial skills, such as saving for a toy, understanding the difference between needs and wants, or making change.
* **Using Real-Life Examples:**  Connect financial concepts to real-life situations that children can relate to, such as saving for a new bike or earning allowance for completing chores.
* **Playing Financial Games:**  Financial board games or apps can make learning about money fun and engaging for children.

**3. Fostering Financial Responsibility:**
* **Allowance and Chores:** Provide children with allowances or pay them for completing chores to teach them about earning and managing money.
