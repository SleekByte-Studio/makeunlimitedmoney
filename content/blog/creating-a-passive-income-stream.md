## "What is Passive Income?"

Passive income is income earned with minimal effort and ongoing involvement. It's often generated from assets you own, investments you've made, or businesses you've set up that run autonomously. Unlike active income, which requires you to actively work for it (like a job), passive income continues to generate revenue even while you're sleeping, traveling, or pursuing other interests.

## "Why Create a Passive Income Stream?"

There are numerous reasons why individuals and families seek to build passive income streams:

* **Financial Freedom:** Passive income can provide a sense of financial security and independence. It can help you reach your financial goals faster, like early retirement, debt reduction, or achieving financial stability.
* **Time Flexibility:**  Passive income allows you to control your time more effectively.  You can work less or pursue other passions without worrying about losing your primary source of income.
* **Diversification:** Diversifying your income sources reduces your reliance on a single income stream. It creates a safety net in case of job loss or unexpected financial challenges.
* **Long-Term Growth:** Many passive income strategies, like real estate or stock investments, offer the potential for long-term growth and appreciation.
* **Legacy Building:**  Passive income can be a valuable way to build a legacy for future generations. You can leave behind assets that continue to generate income for your loved ones.
