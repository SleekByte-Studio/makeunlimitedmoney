- **Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA):** This service handles everything from storage and packaging to shipping and customer service, allowing you to focus on product sourcing and marketing.
- **Competition:** The sheer number of sellers on Amazon can create fierce competition, demanding strong product differentiation and effective marketing strategies.

**Part 2: Choosing Your Selling Strategy**

Now that you have a basic understanding of the platforms, the next step is to decide on your selling strategy. This involves determining your niche, sourcing products, and choosing a fulfillment model.

**Niche Selection:**
